Greetings, Premium!
Please, read all information carefully, it's very important first of all for you personally.
Great! Let's check your knowledge :)

1. If I ask "when next signal", "I hope", "just this one if it is correct», I’m…
 Doing right thing
 Doing it wrong
2. Why have you chosen this option?
 Because premium chat is always opened for any sort of questions
 Because I always can contact Alfred or J
 Because I must read
3. Mark right statement
 Following every signal blindly is totally OK because it will bring many Xs to my investment and I trust D Man
 Following every signal is understanding of risk and that there is no such thing as a sure investment
4. When investing all-in in any particular coin is OK?
 When we are speaking about GEMs and Super GEMs
 It’s fine, if I understand risks of it
 Never, every trade comes with risk of losing all coins
5. I won’t invest:
 If I have less then 30% of my portfolio in BTC
 If I can’t afford to lose this amount
 If I can’t predict price movement
6. Is it good to borrow money for investments?
 Yes, if I borrowed it from family / friend
 No, never. I don't have same psychology when I trade other people's money like when I’m trading with my own money. I risk only what I can.
7. Who is responsible for your decisions around your capital?
 D Man
 Market
 Me
8. After finishing this quiz, what will you do next?
 Will read entire Premium chats
 Will check all actual signals
 Will read all Wisdom Posts on Signals page
9. Should you prefer futures to spot if you are new to trading?
 Not at all, both are good if I use not more than 50% of my portfolio for futures
 No, I should avoid it and use not more than 10% of my total portfolio
 Yes, of course, futures give me ability of fast earning
10. Should you follow signal if you don’t understand it?
 Yes, D Man thought of it for me.
 No, I should not FOMO, better to skip it.
 I will ask other Premiums for help, they know more than me, so I avoid additional researches.
11. If your investment go to minus, what will you do?
 Sell it immediately and cry in chats that Blockchain Whispers scammed me.
 I will be patient and prepared for holding even in minus. Not to grave, of course. I will take profits on targets and spend some on hookers!
12. Mark what can you do in Blockchain Whispers chats:
 Post contract address, I’m kind guy and want to help brothers to find info quickly
 Leave my contact info in chat.
 Post any links or social networks usernames/accounts
 Respect my premium brothers, help them find info instead of posting links/addresses/…, do my own researches
13. When you are allowed to ask questions in Premium Chat?
 When I have question
 When I have >49 likes
 When I have avatar
14. If you will ignore rule from previous question …
 I will be banned forever from the BCW
 I will be muted for 1-3 days
 I will be warned by BCW staff
15. Sharing links / contract addresses / twitter usernames / … results in:
 Warning
 Full Ban
 Mute for 7 days
16. And last question... Just to remind you about our features. If you want to have your coins well-organized, tracked across exchanges, ETH wallets and manual portfolios, what tool suits you best?
 My memory. It's better than any organizer! Even if I have 100 coins, I still will be able to remember every coin and the amount I've ever bought.
 I will use my notepad. It is an ancient way to track and record everything. Yes, it can't connect to the exchanges in real-time and can't scan my ETH wallet on multiple networks and even can be lost or burnt, but I found of working with calculator and pen with my bare hands :D
 I will use BlockchainWhispers Portfolio application that I can easily find in navigation bar, because it can't be lost, burnt or stolen, it does not make mistakes in calculations, can track my exchanges, metamask, ETH wallets on 10 different networks, with just a few clicks and without pain in ass!

Okay, I'm here, how to start?

Congratulations on becoming Blockchain Whispers Premium! We're happy to have a new family member in here. Let's begin with few important posts from D Man.

Maybe you are new here. Welcome.
New is not bad. In fact, it's an exciting new world ahead of you - world of Blockchain Whispers Premium opportunities.

However, you're not here on picnic. You have some shit to do, starting now.

You must READ.

Reading with understanding is underestimated how important it is. If you ask "when next signal", "I hope", "just this one if it is correct"... you're doing it wrong.

Please, read. Read as much back you can, mark important posts, read them again. Be clear. This is your coins we talk about, you must do the best for them.

Speaking of which, it leads us to some of the following understandings when using Blockchain Whispers Premium.

RULE AND UNDERSTANDING NUMBER ONE:
You understand, accept and are aware that there is no such thing as a sure investment. Every coin I give or a series of coins can go to full ZERO. Worth nothing.

Every signal I give comes with a RISK. And when we talk about risk, it's imperative you are in agreement with...

UNDERSTANDING NUMBER TWO:
You will NEVER invest all-in in any particular coin. EVER.

Understanding number three:
YOU WILL NEVER EVER EVER invest money you cannot afford to lose.

Crypto can be seductive, attractive, calling to your prime instincts of greed, need, and desire... you may think that you need extra capital to make fortunes. Let me tell you, today on chat I've heard from member yz, how he got with Blockchain Whispers with approximately $950 to approximately $250,000. I have witnessed many times, topping up more money on wrong trading strategy losing it all, and when I'd have a real winning strategy, even small funds with great entry could multiply me. This is a side reason. The other side reason is: you don't have same psychology when you trade other people's money... if you're like me... you're even more worried even more careful with other people's funds (that's why I don't do it anymore, it's too stressful, for what? money? fuck it). The MAIN reason is: you don't invest money you cannot lose because YOU CAN LOSE IT. Okay? Yes, it's real. You can lose it. If you go 2x long on btc, you can still lose it. And many did. There is no such thing as a safe trade. Forget it. Risk only what you can. That means, never take anyone else's funds to invest for them too. People will tell you they understand risk until risk comes, and then those tapping you on the back start bitching to you how idiot you are, how nobody would do such thing, etc etc. Trust me, I know :)

Alright...

These are the rules, essential rules before beginning anything.

Now, our chat community members have prepared their own set of rules for you. I am pasting them:

------------------------------
10 BCW COMMANDMENTS

(by Hyde, rev. By Mr. K)
1.  D Man is D Man. He has a special relationship with BTC, which gives him an extremely high accuracy rate in his predictions. He also has a formidable skill in finding GEMS. However, remember that he is human. He makes mistakes as well. Use him as Your edge, not Your oracle.

2.  You are solely responsible for Your decisions around Your capital. The most important rule is, only invest what you are comfortable with losing. You alone control your capital. Control your greed. It is up to You if You will use the signal or not.

3.  Educate Yourself. Read Wisdom Posts. If You don’t understand something, read it again. If You still have problem with understanding it – ask fellow Brothers in Premium chat.

4.  Manage Your portfolio the right way. Divide it at least by 2. Best by 3. 1/3 will remain in BTC, 1/3 will be for spot signals, 1/3 for GEMS. For spot signals we usually use 10% of spot portfolio. For Gems usually up to 20% of gems portfolio. Unused assets hold in BTC – unless D Man says otherwise – or You have a reason for it. Make your own calculations and setup your portfolio. Management is important!

5.  Avoid Futures. Most Premium members for a reason focus on SPOT only.  If You decide otherwise – use no more than 10% of Your TOTAL portfolio. For each Futures trade use only 5-10% of futures portfolio (so 0.5 – 1 % of total portfolio pro trade). All gains made in FUTURES go to SPOT. No other way around. Do not overleverage – in most cases x10 is more than enough.

6.  Read signals with understanding. Do your own research. Check at least basic facts. Be sure what are You entering in. If buying on Uniswap – be sure to check contract address and gas fees. All most important informations are given in SIGNAL. How to enter, when to enter, etc.  KEEP BCW SIGNAL SECRET.

7.  If You do not understand the signal – skip it. Do not FOMO. Do not rush into trade. You do not want to buy at peak. BCW has great potential. With some coins which have small liquidity we might have great influence on price. It is better to buy unnoticed. Set limit orders for smaller portions at different levels. Do not enter the trade when extremely late and signaled coin made already significant movement upwards.

8.  Pay respect to other BCW Members. Learn from their experience. They will help you. Be productive and help others as well. You are not alone in crypto. Together we are strong. Add value to the group and you will receive value.

9.  Don’t be greedy. Don’t expect everything to pump right in one go. Be patient, and prepare to hold in minus sometimes even. Don’t sell early, but don’t hold bags to the grave either. You got into the coin, you’re supposed to get out as well. Take profits on targets!

10.  Be wise. Never enter all in. Never share your Private keys. Watch out for scams. You are not alone. Share informations with Your Brothers and Sisters – they might know something that You are not aware of.

----------------------------------

Now the CHAT RULES

1) never post contract address in chat, instead help people find it. The easiest official way is to go to blockchainwhispers.com and type in coin name in the search box on the right. Or use Coins page, it has much more interesting filters that may give you edge you are looking for. Then you find the coin info with the official contract listed. Same you can do when you want to know where is it listed. You click exchanges and you get hyperlinks directly to that pair on exchange you like. Use BCW Swap widget to easily and securely exchange your coins right here. It includes 70+ liquidity pools from 1inch, Uniswap, SushiSwap, ... Don't forget about your best personal assistant in the crypto space - BlockchainWhispers Portfolio. You will find it in the navigation bar. I won't tell you long stories about why it's so superb. Go and try it, you should.
2) never post your contact info or any contact info. Both of these measures (1 and 2) are to protect you from eventual scam. We never had scam in Premium chat so far, and I wish to keep it that way for as long as possible. But your brain is the main determinator for that.
3) don't post links. No links of any kind or official sites of coin or big ass, verfiable trustworthy things. That doesn't indlude twitter profiles - if guy has under 1 million followers, don't post it. Simple.

Other than that, enjoy here. You can do really well. You can do really bad. I believe, as many, many, many Premiums will vouch for on the Premium chat... it depends mainly on you, your approach and how many mistakes YOU make.

If you drop to zero, the key is what you do there: do you stay down, do you dust off and get up and do the same again, or you dust off get up and don't repeat the same mistake.

D Man cares for you. I do. However, read with understanding. It's your coins and your decisions alone. I get hyper over something. I might even say "will". It is always "might". There is no certainty in trading.

Once you grasp the concept, you might actually even start liking it.

And prepare yourself for some nerve-testing periods... periods of red. Periods of slow. Periods of idiots bragging how they made money on BitConnect lol or such kind of shit. You know you. you do you.

Newbies, you came here to learn something, to benefit.
You're CONDITIONALLY welcome to the Blockchain Whispers Community.
Premium membership buys you signals.
Premium membership does NOT buy you access to the Premium chat. It is a privilege.
With your hearts and contributions, you earn respect.
With more respect, people want to help you more, and you become a true family member.

IF you have under 50 hearts - it is FORBIDDEN to ask any sort of questions.

Because 90% of the questions newbies find have their answers if you properly read this section, wisdom, gems, D Man's updates. Also, I, D Man, respect more my loyal members who stuck with me in red times, and in strong winds and I won't let them be bothered or the amazing and super-productive atmosphere in Premium chat to be deteriorated because of a couple of lazy newbs who won't read a couple of posts to get up to date.  Lazy doesn't get you far in life. Same with trading. You have an edge here. You are highly recommended to use it.

Once you have over 50 hearts, you can change your name, get from footsoldier to real member of the Famiglia... we don't do the blood oath. We do the brotherly one... to contribute and care about Blockchain Whispers premium brothers and family.
-- violating asking questions under 50 hearts results in 1-3 days chat access ban.

Links sharing, twitter handles, usernames etc is resulting in full ban.

With that said, I don't like threats (of banning) or bullshit, but for new members it takes time to realize this is different than every and any other community they have been into: Blockchain Whispers Premium is caring, effective and amazing.

Now, please, continue reading the gem posts, wisdom posts, get yourself up to date. Proper planning helps you set yourself for a prosperous future. Invest in your education. Love you.

D Man

I read everything above, let's proceed! (180 seconds left)

A Penny Saved Is A Penny Earned.. my father used to repeat to me.For that I hated him :)Only...
A Penny Saved Is A Penny Earned
.. my father used to repeat to me.

For that I hated him :)

Only to realize that more truthful words have never been spoken when it comes to trading.

Now, I will share with you one secret, that even top professional traders can benefit. So powerful, yet so simple that after revealing it might sound so obvious.

I will share it with you because it elevated my trading to the next level when I was monitoring my traders and predicting when they will make the wrong and when the right call.

I noticed one common pattern...

when the trade would take longer than they predicted it will, it would have way higher odds of failure than when it was within an expected timeframe
I had a fortune to watch the rise and the fall of one of the most successful leverage bitcoin traders in the past 10 months. He had 95% accuracy on 50x trades... and yet those five % were MOSTLY those which he could prevent if he simply got out of the trade that wasn't developing as planned.

Top pros know risk management and portfolio management, and charts and all... and yet they forget the most obvious... if you see it not developing as you predicted when you decided to enter the trade... why not exit it before a loss?

As soon as it gets out of the pattern you predicted for it, it becomes a pure 'hope so' gamble.

They asked me today for D man's secret never told.

This is it.

Love,
D
